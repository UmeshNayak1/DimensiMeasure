## 🧪 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dimensimeasure.git
cd dimensimeasure
```

### 2. Setup Frontend (React + TS)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Setup Backend (Node + Express)

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Setup Python Flask API

```bash
cd python-cv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 5. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

Ensure PostgreSQL is running. Create a DB and update the credentials in your backend config file (`.env`).

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=dimensimeasure
```
